# 👋 Let me introduce myself!

Hello, I am Fenimoure, a seventeen year old teenager and also a student of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv.
I am always eager on learning different stuff. Of course, it is much better if there is some person that can explain it to me in an interesting way (if I don't think "to hell, when will it end??" you know you are successful at this).


## 🧐 Particularly, I am interested in:
- Learning stuff about operating systems (features nobody knows about or how it works)
- Web-development
- Neural networks
- Machine learning
- Computer design (Like, making avatars in GIMP)
