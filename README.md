- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fenimoure
- 👀 I’m interested in literally nothing. I've burnt out even before I could learn anything. 
- 🌱 I’m currently struggling with Python and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, but be ready for me not knowing how to do anything...
- 📫 How to reach me: my Telegram is @Fenimoure, you're welcome. I'll be glad if you lit up interest for programming in me again.
